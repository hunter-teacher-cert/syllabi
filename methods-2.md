# Course Description

This course will prepare teacher-candidates to use a variety of pedagogical techniques including both general and those specific to teaching computer science.
Teacher-candidates will also become knowledgable in social and ethical issues related to computer science and computing including privacy, cyber bullying, and piracy. Teacher-candidates will learn to use a variety of technical tools to both administer their class as well as to support instruction and learning.
Within each of the specific topics, attention will be paid to working with diverse populations as well as aligning lessons to the proposed CSTA standards. Additionally, topics such as classroom management techniques, questioning, and using assessments to drive instruction will be woven throughout all of the units.
