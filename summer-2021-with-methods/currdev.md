In Schools Selected By The College.

## Expected Learning Outcomes
**By The End Of This Course, Students Will Be Able To:**

* Design Units, Courses, And Sequences Of Courses In Computer Science Appropriate For A Diverse Population Of Students.
* Design Units, Courses, And Sequences Of Courses Aligned To Emerging Local, State, And Professional Standards In Computer Science Education.
* Employ Current Technologies And Tools To Support The Development And Deployment Of Designed Materials.
* Adapt, Customize, And Implement Existing And New Curricular Materials In Computer Science Education.

## Methods Of Evaluation

* Assignments (Exclusive Of The Term Curriculum Project) (25%)
* Developed Curriculum And Class Presentation (55%)
* Class Participation (Including Asynchornous Discussion & Group Work) (20%)
* Field Work: Must Complete 50 Hours To Earn A Passing Grade In This Class
  * Most fieldwork will consist of observing other teachers, being observed by fellow candidates & having post observation discussions.
  * Some of the fieldwork must be in the K-5 space, we are working on providing opportunities to work with K-5 teachers, as all candidates are currently in 6-12.
