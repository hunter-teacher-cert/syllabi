# Methods for teaching computer science

# Course Description

Familiarizes teachers, grades with pedagogical approaches and
innovative teaching techniques needed to convey to a diverse
population emerging state and professional standards-based curriculum
in computer science. Innovative uses of technology, development of
instructional units, individualizing for a diverse population of
students, and strategies for managing problem behavior will be
emphasized throughout the course.

## Summer intensive implementation notes

To take advantage of the summer intensive model, the methods class
will be integrated with the other classes offered in the summer intensive. 

The major class project will be combined with the CS Topics project
delivered by students (see Topics syllabus for details).

Delivery of the class material will be done through introducing topics
while teaching the other summer intensive classes followed by blocks
of time specifically devoted to discussion of the pedagical techniques
modeled. Discussions include coverage of the topic (see below for
topic listing), alternatives, and customizaiton for different student
populations and circumstances.

## Grading

 - 40% : Demonstration of an understanding of CS teaching methods through class discussion, breakout rooms, small presentations.
 - 40% : Use of effective methods in delivery of Topics project
 - 20% : participation


## By the end of this course, students will be able to:
   - develop coherent, meaningful goals, plans and materials.
   - Plan and deliver effective computer science instruction.
   - assess learning and differentiate instruction for diverse populations.
   - Employ a variety of effective pedagogical standards in order to deliver instruction aligned with the proposed CSTA standards.
   - Use current technology and CS content and wil be able to learn new technologies and content. Teacher-candidates will be able to develop coherent, meaningful goals, plans, and materials.
