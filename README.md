# syllabi

# Overview

This summer intenstive consists of four classes 3 credit classes plus prework. The sequence is described as:

 1. Programming in a high level language (including pre-work)
 2. Data Structures
 3. Topics
 4. Methods
 
 but Topics and Methods will at be at least in part interwoven into the first two courses.
 

## Grading

### Programming in a high level language, data structures, and topics are project based. They will be graded as follows:

 - 80% : Projects/programming assignments
 - 20% : Participation

Programming in a high level language and Data Structures will consist of day to day programs and assignments. Topics will also include a major group project to be presented to the class as a whole.


### Methods grading policy 

 - 40% : Demonstration of an understanding of CS teaching methods through class discussion, breakout rooms, small presentations.
 - 40% : Use of effective methods in delivery of Topics project
 - 20% : participation

### Data Structures

This course is analagous to a College CS2 (Data Structures Class). 
While we're not using a fixed text, here are some useful data structure web sites. Each site has a section matching the topics listed below. Topics will be covered roughly sequentially with assignments in the day2day directory of the class repository:

  - https://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-tutorial
  - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/
  - Data structure visualizations: https://visualgo.net/en
  - More visualizations: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html
