# syllabi

# Overview

This summer intenstive consists of four classes 3 credit classes plus prework. The sequence is described as:

 1. Programming in a high level language (including pre-work)
 2. Data Structures
 3. Topics
 4. Methods
 
 but Topics and Methods will at be at least in part interwoven into the first two courses.
 

## Grading

### Programming in a high level language, data structures, and topics are project based. They will be graded as follows:

 - 80% : Projects/programming assignments
 - 20% : Participation

Programming in a high level language and Data Structures will consist of day to day programs and assignments. Topics will also include a major group project to be presented to the class as a whole.


### Methods grading policy 

 - 40% : Demonstration of an understanding of CS teaching methods through class discussion, breakout rooms, small presentations.
 - 40% : Use of effective methods in delivery of Topics project
 - 20% : participation

## Programmng in a high level language

## By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand the basics of object oriented computer programming including classes, methods, variables, data flow, data types and data structures.
2. Write programs of moderate complexity 
3. Acquire data from outside sources and use programming techniques to analyze data and visualize results.
5. Use techniques from the field of computer science and apply them to problems in other fields.

  - learn the fundamentals of each subfield studied in this course.
  - use online and community resources to further their own professional development and study of computer science.
  - design and implement developmentally appropriate computer science instructional content for a diverse population of learners based on content learned in this course.


Specific topics will be determined by prior to the end of the data structures unit.

Suggested project topics:
  1. Full stack development with Flask
  2. Genetic Programming
  3. 3D computer graphics
  4. Ray Tracing
  5. Data mining (clustering)

The instructors will deliver lessons in selected topics determined based on student project selections.
  
  


### Methods

## By the end of this course, students will be able to:
   - develop coherent, meaningful goals, plans and materials.
   - Plan and deliver effective computer science instruction.
   - assess learning and differentiate instruction for diverse populations.
