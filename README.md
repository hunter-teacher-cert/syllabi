# syllabi

# Overview

This summer intenstive consists of four classes 3 credit classes plus prework. The sequence is described as:

 1. Programming in a high level language (including pre-work)
 2. Data Structures
 3. Topics
 4. Methods
 
 but Topics and Methods will at be at least in part interwoven into the first two courses.
 

## Grading

### Programming in a high level language, data structures, and topics are project based. They will be graded as follows:

 - 80% : Projects/programming assignments
 - 20% : Participation



### Methods will be graded 

 - 40% : Demonstration of an understanding of CS teaching methods
 - 40% : Deomonstration of the ability to decide on what methods to use and when
 - 20% : participation

## Programmng in a high level language

### Prework
 1. Setting up a Java development envirotnment and GitHub
 1. Your first Java program.
 1. data Types
 1. Void methods
 1. Conditionals
 1. Value Methods
 1. Loops
 1. Arrays
 1. Prework final project
 
 Specific details on the prework can be found here: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/pre-work
 
###  Programming in a high level language
This course (including the prework) is analagous to a college CS1 cousre. 

Text https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/

 1. Fundamental Recursion
 1. 2D Arrays
   1. Introduction to 2D arrays

 1. Creating Classes
 1. Introduction to Data Structures (creating a SuperArray Class)


### Data Structures

This course is analagous to a College CS2 (Data Structures Class). 
While we're not using a fixed text, here are some useful data structure web sites. Each site has a section matching the topics listed below. Topics will be covered roughly sequentially with assignments in the day2day directory of the class repository:

  - https://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-tutorial
  - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/
  - Data structure visualizations: https://visualgo.net/en
  - More visualizations: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html

  1. Linked Lists 
    1. Creating a linked list
    1. Insertion / search / deletion
    1. Comparing and contrasting Linked Lists with Array based structurs
  1. Built in Java Classes - ArrayList and LinkedList
  1. Stacks and Queues
    1. Linked List implementations
    2. Array based implementaitons
    3. Creating a stack via inheritence vs encapsulation
  1. Sorting / Searching
    1. Linear searching
    2. Binary Search
    3. Introduction to runtime - Big O notation
    4. Slow sorts
    5. Merge sort

      5. runtime analysis
    3. More advanced trees
    
### Topics

Specific topics will be determined by prior to the end of the data structures unit.

### Methods

CS Methods will be integrated in other three courses. 

- Live Coding
