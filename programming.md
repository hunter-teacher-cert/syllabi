# Programming in a high level language

# Course Description

Programming in a high level language introduces students to computer programming and goes well beyond an introductory class. The course will provide an overview of a language such as Java language and dive into important programming concepts including object-oriented programming, inheritance, exception handling, debugging techniques  and more. 

## Grading

 - 80% : Projects/programming assignments (listed by topic)
 - 20% : Participation


## By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the basics of object oriented computer programming including classes, methods, variables, data flow, data types and data structures.
2. Write programs of moderate complexity 
3. Acquire data from outside sources and use programming techniques to analyze data and visualize results.
5. Use techniques from the field of computer science and apply them to problems in other fields.
