# Topics in Computer Science

# Course Description

This course will provide aspiring and practicing teachers with base
knowledge in a number of the most important disciplines in computer
science. Students will study and create working systems using a
variety of tools, techniques, and technologies.  Sample topics include
functional programming, data mining, computer graphics, and artificial
intelligence.

## Grading

 - 80% : Projects/programming assignments
 - 20% : Participation

The topics class will require each student to work in a team to
research and deliver a project on a topic in computer science that
they select. The project will include both a GitHub repo consisting of
the documentation and source code and a class presentation.
	
The project must:

	1. Exhibit that the participants have a knowledge and understanding of the topic. 
	2. Include a lesson or unit outline illustrating how they would deliver instruction on this topi.c
	3. Show an understanding of appropriate pedagogical techniques that could be used when delivering instruction based on this topic.
	4. Code illustrating at least proof of concept on the selected topic.


## By the end of this course, students will be able to:
  - learn the fundamentals of each subfield studied in this course.
  - use online and community resources to further their own professional development and study of computer science.
  - design and implement developmentally appropriate computer science instructional content for a diverse population of learners based on content learned in this course.
